phase: Post-MVP documentation

completed[8]{task,detail}:
  Phase 0: Infrastructure,Added workspace deps envrc gitignore; upgraded Rust 1.82->1.85 for edition2024 transitive deps
  Phase 1: Config + Git Repo,config.rs (.gitreview INI parser layered config) git.rs (gix wrapper for repo discovery HEAD config hooks)
  Phase 2: Gerrit REST Client,gerrit.rs (reqwest client XSSI stripping serde types all endpoints) with mockito integration tests
  Phase 3: Push Workflow,push.rs (refspec builder Change-Id extraction) hook.rs (vendored commit-msg) subprocess.rs (git helpers credential flow)
  Phase 4: Comment Retrieval,comments.rs (thread resolution algorithm LLM-optimized text output structured JSON output)
  Phase 5: CLI Wiring,main.rs (clap derive command tree) app.rs (App struct wiring config+git+gerrit)
  Phase 6: End-to-End & Polish,Fixed clippy warnings cargo-deny issues (MPL-2.0 Zlib CDLA-Permissive-2.0 licenses gix 0.70->0.79 security advisory work_dir deprecation)
  Phase 7: Design Doc Population,Populated 5 stub design docs (gerrit-client cli-design config-system git-operations error-handling) from source code and ref-specs

in_progress: Nothing

next_steps[4]:
  Manual testing against a real Gerrit instance (setup push comments version)
  Populate remaining 4 stub design docs (data-model tui-design search-engine sync-engine) — these cover unimplemented features
  Create ADRs for key design decisions as they emerge
  Begin TUI and SQLite work (post-MVP)

test_status: 75 tests passing (58 lib + 9 main + 8 integration)
lint_status: cargo fmt clippy deny all pass clean

handoff_notes[12]:
  MVP CLI is fully implemented: push comments setup version commands
  75 tests all passing (58 lib unit + 9 main unit + 8 mockito integration)
  cargo fmt --check passes
  cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings passes clean
  cargo deny check passes (advisories ok bans ok licenses ok sources ok)
  gix upgraded from 0.70 to 0.79 (fixed GHSA-2frx-2596-x5r6 SHA-1 advisory)
  deny.toml licenses: added MPL-2.0 (option-ext/dirs) Zlib (foldhash/hashbrown) CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (webpki-roots)
  Rust toolchain 1.85.0 (upgraded from 1.82.0 for edition2024 transitive deps)
  All cargo commands must run via nix develop shell (not rustup)
  Source tree: lib.rs app.rs config.rs gerrit.rs git.rs push.rs comments.rs hook.rs subprocess.rs + resources/commit-msg
  5 design docs populated from stub to draft: gerrit-client cli-design config-system git-operations error-handling
  4 design docs remain as stubs: data-model tui-design search-engine sync-engine (these cover unimplemented features)
