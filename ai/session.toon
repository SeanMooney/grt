next_steps[4]:
  Populate design doc stubs using completed ref-specs (see traceability matrix in docs/design/README.md)
  Create ADRs for key design decisions as they emerge
  Begin implementation starting with data model and Gerrit client
  Enhance flake.nix with static musl build and cargo-deny check in nix checks

handoff_notes[7]:
  ref/ directory contains Python source code for all three reference projects
  ref/ca-bhfuil/ has its own CLAUDE.md and extensive docs
  ref/gertty/ is the most complex reference — start with its data model
  All 7 ref-specs are complete and ready as input for design docs
  Cargo workspace builds and passes all checks (cargo build test clippy fmt deny)
  Build infrastructure in place: justfile flake.nix deny.toml rust-toolchain.toml nextest.toml
  tech-stack.md is now adopted — all docs updated to reference adopted path and use gix/sqlx terminology
